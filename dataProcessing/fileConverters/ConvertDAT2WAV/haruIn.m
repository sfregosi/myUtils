                              haruIn(filename, startFrame, nFrames, chans)
%haruIn   Read data from a Haru-format file (.dat, .sdat; from NOAA/PMEL lab).
%
% [sams,nchan,sampleSize,sRate,nLeft,dt] = haruIn(filename, start, n, chans)
%    Read Haru Matsumoto's file format (from Chris Fox's lab).  Such files
%    typically have names like 00000318.DAT or 00000318.SDAT or DATAFILE.318, or
%    possibly r0125502.28 or r0125502.28m130.  
%    
%    Input arguments:
%      start      starting sample number; default is 0, meaning the
%                 first sample in the file
%      n          number of samples to read per channel; default is Inf,
%                 meaning read the entire file
%      chans      which channels to read; default is all of them; channel
%                 numbering starts at 1
%
%    Output arguments:
%      sams       column vector of samples (or multi-column array, if
%                 chans's length is >= 2)
%      nchan      how many channels are in the file (equals 1 for all
%                 extant Haru-format files, but who knows about the future)
%      sampleSize number of bytes per sample, 1 or 2
%      sRate      sampling rate, Hz
%      nLeft      number of sample frames remaining in the file after
%                 reading (use haruIn(filename, 0, 0) to get the total number
%                 of samples in the file)
%      dt         date/time (in GMT) that the file starts, encoded as
%                 in datenum
%      endDt      date/time (in GMT) of the first sample after the end of the
%                 file; this output arg is available only for SDAT files
%
% Some Haru-files (ETP before Nov. 99, MAR) do not encode their sampling rate,
% so I have to guess.  I'll tell you when I'm guessing.  To override this 
% guess, do something like this:
%          global opHaruSrate; opHaruSrate=112;
%
% Note: Reading of .SDAT files is handled by sdatIn.m, which you can call
% directly if you like or do it via this function. There are also CF2-format
% .DAT files, which are read by cf2In.m.

% There are two time-date strings in Haru files.  The first is from the QTech
% clock, which is generally the more accurate, temperature-corrected one.  
% The second is from the Real-Time Clock (RTC), essentially the computer's
% system clock; it's less accurate.
%
% The RTC is set periodically (Matt said maybe once a day) from the QTech
% clock, so the two should never be far apart.  However, upon a reboot, the
% QTech clock doesn't know what time it is, so it gets set from the RTC.  
% So the QTech clock can have a small quantum jump at that point, equal to
% the amount that the RTC was off.  One good way to estimate the jump is
% by looking at the last Haru-file recorded before the reboot, and calculate
% the difference between the two clocks.  A better way would probably be to
% estimate the drift rate between the two clocks, then add the appropriate
% amount of drift to that last-file clock difference.  I've never done the
% latter.
